# ReinforcementLearning_DistributionalQR_DDQN_DQN_Prioritization

The above project was done as part of the final project for the course Stochastic Systems and Reinforcement Learning, taken at USC under Prof. Rahul Jain.
The project consists of the following topics:
DQN (Deep Q Networks)
DDQN (Double Deep Q Networks)
Prioritized Experience Replay in DQN
Distributional Reinforcement Learning with Quantile Regression

The code attached is only for the DQN network, since the latter 3 parts were coded differently, 'differently' meaning that there were certain novel changes
made to a generic code, taking into account the memory of the agent in a fashion not considered previously, yielding marked results. The code is being combined
in a paper, and thus, will only be presented upon request.

The report describes the entirety of the project, the theory, the algorithms used, the papers referred and the novel modifications made therein.
